## Set your server public IP address ##

## Set and drop these IP ranges on public interface ##

## Skip loop back interface - Skip all PF processing on interface ##
set skip on lo
 
## Sets the interface for which PF should gather statistics such as bytes in/out and packets passed/blocked ##
set loginterface $ext_if
 
## Set default policy ##
block return in log all
block out all
 
# Deal with attacks based on incorrect handling of packet fragments 
scrub in all
 
# Drop all Non-Routable Addresses

block drop out quick on $ext_if from any to $martians
 
## Blocking spoofed packets
